# OdinSchool-ClassicCars-Sales
OdinSchool capstone project on Classic Cars sales anlaysis using SQL and PowerBI 
üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive and insightful Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI and SQL. The primary goal was to analyze order data, understand customer behavior, track employee performance, and gain actionable business insights across various dimensions such as product categories, geographies, customer segments, and time.

The dashboard visualizations were built after thorough preprocessing and querying of the dataset using SQL for data extraction and transformation.

üîç Key Objectives
Analyze total sales performance over time and geography.
Monitor employee-wise and customer-wise contribution to total order value.
Visualize product line performance and identify top-selling categories.
Study payment status and pending payments across different customers.
Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
Identify key segments such as Champions, At-Risk, Potential Loyalists, and more.

üõ† Tools & Technologies Used
Microsoft Power BI ‚Äì for data visualization and dashboard creation.
MySQL ‚Äì for data querying and transformation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì for dynamic metrics and calculated columns.
AI Assistance (ChatGPT) ‚Äì for resolving complex logic, debugging, and learning support.

üìå Key Features of the Dashboard
1. Employee Performance Page
View total sales handled by each employee.
Monthly trend of order value processed.
Distribution of sales across product lines.
Country-wise contribution for the selected employee.
Dynamic filtering by employee name.

2. Customer-wise Analysis Page
Shows selected customer‚Äôs total orders, amount paid, credit limit, and pending payment %.
Order value trend across months and years.
Region and company-specific insights to understand customer value.

3. Customer Segmentation and Payment Insights
Visual analysis of pending payment percentages by customer.
Customer segments shown by count (Champions, At Risk, etc.).
Tree map showing total order value by customer name and RFM segment.
Helps in identifying top-performing and risky customers for better decision-making.

üí° Learnings
This project was an incredible learning journey. While working on it, I:

Sharpened my SQL skills with real-world queries involving joins, groupings, and filters.
Learned how to structure data models effectively for Power BI.
Understood how to create dynamic visuals and interactivity using slicers, filters, and measures.
Gained clarity on customer segmentation using RFM analysis principles.

ü§ñ Role of AI in Learning
AI tools (like ChatGPT) played a major role in guiding me through this project:
Helped explain complex SQL queries and Power BI DAX logic.
Assisted in debugging and optimizing performance issues.
Made it easier to learn from my mistakes and apply corrections on the go.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw data can be turned into powerful business insights using the right tools. It also showcases my growing proficiency in SQL, Power BI, and business intelligence. This is a step forward toward more advanced analytics and data-driven decision-making.
